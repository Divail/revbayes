## title
## description
The fossilized birth death range process describes diversification and sampling of extinct species trees under a mixed model of asymmetric, symmetric and anagenetic speciation.
## details
Fossil species samples are represented by their sampled stratigraphic ranges, consisting of a first and last occurrence, and sample count data. Sampling data may be provided by species, time interval, or both depending on the sampling model assumed. The distribution may describe either sampled trees, in which unsampled tips represent sampling events, or extended trees in which tips represent extinction events.
