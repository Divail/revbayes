dnFossilizedBirthDeathRangeMatrix
## title
## description
The fossilized birth death range matrix process describes the distribution of a matrix of species origin and extinction times under a model of asymmetric speciation and sampling of extinct species.
## details
Fossil species samples are represented by their sampled stratigraphic ranges, consisting of a first and last occurrence, and sample count data. Sampling data may be provided by species, time interval, or both depending on the sampling model assumed.
